Dynamic, automated, text-based conversations have benefits and advantages for both program participants and administrators. Specifically these conversations provide opportunity to:

__Utilise popular messaging platforms to improve engagement and simplify participation__
- Host your program in messaging applications that participants use all day, every day
- Messaging platforms include: Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, and SMS
- Popular messaging platforms are available 24/7 and require no participant training

__Build and maintain positive relationships with participants__
- Personalise and customise your program to maximise response rates and minimise attrition
- Reward ongoing participation by sharing collected insights, where and when possible
- Respect participant’s need for flexibility, e.g. accepting requests to reschedule input
- Offer customised referrals to relevant information resources or services

__Create scalable programs with longevity using low-cost and low-complexity infrastructure__
- Flexible infrastructure can rapidly accommodate program design refinements
- No need to develop and maintain costly, custom smartphone, web, or survey applications
- More customisable and flexible than commercial or freely-available smartphone applications

__Capture timely, specific, and accurate quantitative and qualitative insights__
- Assess quantitative and qualitative insights on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis
- Suitable for a wide range of research and evaluation activities, e.g. diary studies
- Review trends, patterns, and consistency of longitudinal behaviours, emotions, and experiences
- Avoid the use of broad retrospective reporting, e.g. "Thinking about the last month, ..."
- Avoid the use of imprecise Likert scales for frequency, e.g. "Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always"
