__Website:__
Low-complexity chatbots that seek to guide users to specific information or resources may be replaced by a simple website with links. Simple websites can organise and display their content in engaging ways. A chatbot that doesn’t involve significant engagement with the user merely creates complexity and falls short of expectations of a more engaging experience. However, a website is suited for a single engagement and by itself provides limited ability for customisation and interactivity. An example of a chatbot that would be better off as a website is the Lifeline twitter bot. This chatbot only contains button inputs and adds no additional value in it’s current format.

__Online survey:__
An online survey is ideal low-cost way to streamline data collection. They also feature piping and branching to facilitate personalisation. However surveys are a limited format for disseminating information. Multiple engagements can be managed through multiple survey entries.

__Email campaign:__
Campaigns based on email can be used to regularly check in with participants (also known as a ‘drip’ email campaign). Email campaigns can prompt for data or responses from email replies or by linking to resources such as an online survey or web-based application. The greatest strength of email-based campaigns is their simple structure, essentially  a sequence of scheduled, prewritten emails that use custom fields for personalisation. However, this personalisation is generally token as anything beyond basic segmentation is challenging.

__Custom smartphone application:__
Ideal for collecting data at regular intervals. Can use system notifications to draw participants back to the application at regular intervals. However, developing an custom smartphone application is an expensive endeavour. Install rates for third-party applications are lower than ever (REF). Smartphone applications require a lot of resources to develop and maintain across one or multiple platforms (iOS/Android).

Dynamic, automated, text-based conversations have benefits and advantages for both program participants and administrators. Specifically these conversations provide opportunity to:

__Utilise popular messaging platforms to improve engagement and simplify participation__
- Host your program in messaging applications that participants use all day, every day
- Messaging platforms include: Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, and SMS
- Popular messaging platforms are available 24/7 and require no participant training

__Build and maintain positive relationships with participants__
- Personalise and customise your program to maximise response rates and minimise attrition
- Reward ongoing participation by sharing collected insights, where and when possible
- Respect participant’s need for flexibility, e.g. accepting requests to reschedule input
- Offer customised referrals to relevant information resources or services

__Create scalable programs with longevity using low-cost and low-complexity infrastructure__
- Flexible infrastructure can rapidly accommodate program design refinements
- No need to develop and maintain costly, custom smartphone, web, or survey applications
- More customisable and flexible than commercial or freely-available smartphone applications

__Capture timely, specific, and accurate quantitative and qualitative insights__
- Assess quantitative and qualitative insights on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis
- Suitable for a wide range of research and evaluation activities, e.g. diary studies
- Review trends, patterns, and consistency of longitudinal behaviours, emotions, and experiences
- Avoid the use of broad retrospective reporting, e.g. "Thinking about the last month, ..."
- Avoid the use of imprecise Likert scales for frequency, e.g. "Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always"
