#Benefits

Automated, dynamic text-based conversations provide opportunity to:

Utilise popular messaging platforms to improve engagement and simplify participation
- Build and maintain positive relationships with respondents to maximise response rates and minimise attrition
- Provide personalised and customised experiences that consider human-centred design principles
- Respect participantâ€™s need for flexibility, e.g. rescheduling engagement requests
- Motivate participation by sharing data collection insights, where and when possible
- Selectively provide relevant information, such as referrals to resources or services

Create scalable programs with longevity using low-cost and low-complexity infrastructure
- No need to repurpose existing smartphone, web-based, or survey applications - spare resources required to design, develop, deploy, and maintain custom applications - negate the burden of developing custom applications for multiple smartphone platforms (iOS, Android)
- Useful to build conversational agent to demonstrate need/promise before investing in larger app or infrastructure
- Better resource for data collection than scraping commercial applications
- More customisable and flexible than similar tools (e.g. citizen science)
- utilise infrastructure that can accommodate rapid user experience refinements
- avoid dedicated applications and be present where respondents spend their time [REF]
- messaging platforms are available 24/7, highly scalable, and require no training

Capture timely, specific, and accurate quantitative and qualitative insights
- Assess quantitative and qualitative insights on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis
- Suitable for a wide range of research and evaluation activities, e.g. diary studies
- behaviours, emotions, and experiences
- capture longitudinal data and consider consistency**
- ask one question daily, multiple questions at weekly, or any possible variation
- ensure that respondent data is accurate in terms of memory recall and timing
- avoid broad retrospective reporting, e.g. "Thinking about the last month, ..."
- avoid imprecise Likert scales for frequency, e.g. "Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always"
